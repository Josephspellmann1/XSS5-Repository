        <div class="abouttxt1">
            <p>I am the hex girl behind Xana's Spellbound Sweets, a home-based bakery in Phoenix, Arizona. All my sweets are home-brewed with magickal intentions and charged with clear quartz (to enhance the spiritual properties of my ingredients) and other crystals before baking!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="abouttxt2">
            <p>My sweet book-of-spells features an assortment of cookies, brownies, pies, cakes, and more! While all foods have their own natural charms, I also create enchanting potions that are supercharged for specific manifestations. A few of my bewitching creations include Money Manifestation Mint Mocha Brownies (made with mint and coffee to boost dedication, fortune, and success then charged with pyrite for wealth and prosperity) and Chocolate Spice Protection Cookies (made with cinnamon, nutmeg, and a dash of cayenne for safety and strength then charged with black tourmaline for security).</p>
